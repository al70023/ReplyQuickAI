# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the React project with the specified UI framework and set up the project structure for the unified communications history interface demo.
# Details:
1. Create a new React project using Create React App or Vite
2. Install and configure either Material-UI or Chakra UI as specified in the PRD
3. Set up routing using React Router for navigation between Call Logs and SMS Inbox views
4. Configure a state management solution (React Context or Zustand as mentioned in the PRD)
5. Create the basic folder structure:
   - src/
     - components/
     - pages/
     - data/
     - services/
     - context/
     - utils/
     - styles/
6. Set up a basic layout component with navigation between views

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds without errors and the basic navigation works between placeholder pages. Test that the UI framework components render correctly and that the state management solution is properly configured.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React Project and Install Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new React project using Vite and install the required UI framework and routing libraries.
### Details:
Run `npm create vite@latest unified-comms-demo -- --template react-ts` to create a new React project with TypeScript. Then install the UI framework with `npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion` or `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`. Also install React Router with `npm install react-router-dom` and Zustand with `npm install zustand`.

## 2. Create Project Folder Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the recommended folder structure for organizing components, pages, and other resources.
### Details:
Create the following directory structure within the src folder: components/ (for reusable UI components), pages/ (for route-specific views), data/ (for mock data), services/ (for API calls), context/ (for React Context if used), utils/ (for helper functions), and styles/ (for global styles). Add appropriate .gitkeep files to empty folders to ensure they're tracked in version control.

## 3. Configure UI Framework and Global Styles [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up the chosen UI framework provider and configure global styles and theme settings.
### Details:
Create a theme configuration file in src/styles/theme.js. Wrap the application in the appropriate provider component (ChakraProvider or ThemeProvider) in the main.tsx or App.tsx file. Configure theme settings like colors, typography, and spacing according to the PRD. Set up global styles for consistent appearance across the application.

## 4. Implement State Management Solution [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Zustand or React Context for managing application state across components.
### Details:
If using Zustand, create a store in src/store/index.ts with initial state for communications history data. Define actions for fetching, filtering, and updating data. If using React Context, create context providers in src/context/ with appropriate state and dispatch functions. Implement hooks for consuming the context in components.

## 5. Create Layout Component with Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Implement a basic layout component with navigation between Call Logs and SMS Inbox views.
### Details:
Create a Layout component in src/components/Layout/index.tsx that includes a header, navigation menu, and content area. Implement React Router in App.tsx with routes for the Call Logs and SMS Inbox pages. Create placeholder page components in src/pages/ for these routes. Style the navigation to allow switching between views and highlight the active route.
